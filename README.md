**Foundation of Computer System - Computer System A Programmer's Perspective (CSAPP)**

This repository aims to give an introduction to the computer science text book: *Computer System A Programmer's Perspective (CSAPP)*. In this repository, we will talk about the basic components of computer systems. The following is the table of contents:
